German player and game director for the 1979 Avalon Hill game Bismarck.

This provides an opposing player for solo play of the classic Bismarck game. 
Only strategic action is handled here on the game Search Board;
tactical action on the Battle Board can be handled solo, since there is no hidden information there.

Currently only the battleship Bismarck itself is directed; we may assume the companion Prinz Eugen
stays in task force the entire game, or is abandoned if damaged and slowed overmuch.
(Task force management is left for a future update.)

Note that Search Board layer data files are stored as the transpose of the printed map,
so that spreadsheet address codes directly match that on the printed board
(e.g., G1 on the map is actually G1 in the spreadsheet application).
