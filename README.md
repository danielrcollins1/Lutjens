# Lutjens
German player and game director for the 1979 Avalon Hill game Bismarck.

This provides an opposing player for solo play of the classic Bismarck game. 
Only strategic action is handled here on the game Search Board;
tactical action can be handled solo on the Battle Board, since in that mode it has no hidden information.
